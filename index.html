      		<p><b>In 2009</b> the troupe performed their first play which was “The Dollar” by David Pinski</p>
        		<p><b>Plot:</b> The play takes place in the rural countryside in 1920 when a group of
        		(not so good) shakespearian actors are traveling to their next performance when
        		they stumble upon a dollar that quickly turns them against each other.</p>

        		<p>The first performance went better than expected, but during the second performance
        		one of the actors skipped to a line in the play excluding 1/3 of the play, and the
        		performers went with it trying not to bust up laughing. It turned out well, as
        		they were this particular performance was in front of Alzheimer's patients.</p>
    	</article>


    	<article>
     		<p><b>In 2010</b> the troupe began work on their next 2 plays which they did as a back to
        		back performance. The first was a spoof on the story of Pinocchio.</p>

        	<p><b>Plot:</b> The story takes place in Geptto’s workshop when the fairy Modmother
       			(yes it’s spelled like that on purpose) gives Geppeto a choice between turning
       			either a boy or girl doll into a real person. The Modmother makes both Pinocchio
       			and a Shirley Temple doll alive. Geppeto then lives with both of them for a week
       			not being able to choose between them he asks the Modmother to maker them both
       			real which caused unexpected results.</p>

       			<img src="./images/masks.png" />

      		<p>During one performance the entire cast watched in horror as the tiny Jiminy Cricket
      			fell from Pinoccio’s shoulder and shattered into pieces on the stage, and then had
      			to stiffle their laughter and continue on with the play.</p>


      		<p><b>The second play was a spoof on the story of Snow White.</b></p>
      		<p><b>Plot:</b> This one mostly follows the main story with a few
         		small changes. Due not having any apples on hand at the time the evil Queen is
         		forced to us a poisoned banana instead, and in a strange turn of events the
         		woodcutter isn’t who he seems to be and the Queen turns good and falls in love
         		with the dwarf known as Doc.</p>

        	<p>For a change the performance went as expected.</p>

    	</article>


    	<article>
     		<p><b>In 2011</b> the troupe worked on their next spoof which was based on the story of
     			Hansel and Gretel</p>
     		<p><b>Plot:</b> In this version, Hansel is so whinny one almost wishes the witch would
     			eat him just to get some quiet. Add in a confused fairy godmother looking for
     			Cinderella, and a Hansel and Gretel walking off with the deed to the ginger bread
     			house, and a spoof is born.</p>

    		<p>In one scene the actors were supposed to eat candy off of the cardboard prop house.
    			But they happened to choose very chewy candy, so one of the actors ended up swallowing
    			2 starbursts whole, and had to do his lines around a mint in his mouth.</p>

    		<p><b>In 2012</b> The troupe had some trouble recruiting actors, so they did some readers theatre
    			and interactive plays for their audiences. These went fairly well, except
    			when they performed at the local retirement home one of the residents came up and
    			tried to read the actor’s shirt. She also kept telling one of the other actors that
    			she was very beautiful. To her credit, she said thank you and continued on with her lines</p>
